Project on the analysis of the use of Bellabeat devices

This case study is part of the Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

BellaBeat was founded in 2013 as a women's health and fitness technology company. Their products are made for women to provide better tracking-technologies for health, wellness and fitness. BellaBeat consumers can use the information they record while using the apps and devices to assist in providing and advocating for overall better health.

The owner of the company, Urška Sršen, wants an analysis of consumer trends to identify potential growth strategies. This will be done by analyzing smart device usage data from BellaBeat's competitor, FitBit.

The case study links to a dataset from FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, a data set of 30 FitBit users fitness tracker data. This dataset can be used to compare industry trends and what users of competitive technologies use their products for. This can be compared to the data from BellaBeat's product to determine the best growth opportunities.

(Originally completed in R, I wanted to approach this project in Python to compare any similarities and differences, as well as gain insights on which programming language I prefer to use. Please view my notebook file with the R code used for my original analysis: R Analysis: BellaBeat.ipynb))
