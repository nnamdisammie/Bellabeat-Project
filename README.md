## Overview

  This project is a part of the eighth and the final course in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, where the opportunity was given to complete an optional case study. It is based on the analysis of the use of Bellabeat devices. I have carried out the project using python and also made visualizations with the use of Power BI which is shown at the end of this article.
  
  Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. It was founded in 2013 by artist Urška Sršen and mathematician Sando Mur as a women's health and fitness technology company. The company has 5 focus products: bellabeat app, leaf, time, spring and bellabeat membership. It is a successful small company, but has the potential to become a larger company in the global smart device market. Their products are made for women to provide better tracking-technologies for health, wellness and fitness. BellaBeat consumers can use the information they record while using the apps and devices to assist in providing and advocating for overall better health. The company has many products carefully designed to monitor activity, stress, sleep, and reproductive data to help women better understand how their bodies work and make healthier choices. While small in size, Bellabeat has quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. The Chief Executive Officer, Urška Sršen, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.
  
  The CEO wants an analysis of consumer trends to identify potential growth strategies. This will be done by analyzing smart device usage data from BellaBeat's competitor, FitBit. The case study links to a dataset from FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, a data set of 33 FitBit users. This dataset can be used to compare industry trends and what users of competitive technologies use their products for. This can be compared to the data from BellaBeat's product to determine the best growth opportunities.
  
  ## Processing and Analysis
   In the course of carrying out this project, I first imported the datasets from my local machine into the jupyter notebook where the whole activities including visualizations were carried out. Also, in order to make visualizations using Power BI, I also imported the datasets into MySQL where I made queries of the datasets and made  appropriate analysis. Working with python, after importing the relevant datasets into jupyter notebook, I made proper assessments and made cleaning basically in 'ActivityHour' columns where the data type was object. In order to use them as date and time, I changed the data type for ectracting the dates and times. After this was done, I made the analysis and got the necessary columns for various objectives.
   
  ## Key Findings
  
  * About 80 percent of the users live more of a sendentary lifestyle and are not intensely involved in aerobic activites
  * Greater percentage of the users(21 users) were active for 31 days while a few were inconsistent
  * Good exercise activities can amount to burning much calories an in turn promote good sleep which is beneficial to the health
  * The users are most active on Saturday and least active on Sunday
  * Users takes the most steps during the day
  * Users who are sedentary and take minimal steps burn less calories compared to users who are more active and take more steps
  
  ## Recommendations
 * New innovation in the use of the app such that there is a weekly record on one's performance and a reward for high performance will go along way to serve as a good motivation.
 * Providing good orientation to the users on the need to be active especially during weekdays will be helpful since it could be drawn that good exercise activites promote good sleep.
 * The device should be modified such that there is a notification like a beat or vibration after a prolonged period of sedentary minutes, alerting the user it's time to get active. Similarly, it can also remind the user it's time to sleep after sensing a prolonged awake time in bed. This way, there will be an active interaction between the app or device and the user.
  
 ##### When these are implemented, there will be more results and will encourage non-users to go for the products
